# JLL_Map
Hackathon Project (October 2019)

Team was comprised of: Denis Dule, Rohith Poovakkattil Rajan, Armin Maghsoudlou, Rishika Agarwal

The program takes in the AvailabilityDataSample.csv provided by JLL and plots the coordinates of the properties on a map. When clicked on, the markers on the map display the name/address of the property, the median price per sq. ft. and the restaurants nearby.

The html file "map.html" is what the program outputs. Refer to that to see what the end result of the project looks like.

Technologies used: Python 3.7, Google Cloud Libraries/tools used: Google Places API, geopy, folium, pandas
